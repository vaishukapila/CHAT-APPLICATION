description of task 3:
This project is a real-time chat application developed using Socket.IO and Node.js, designed for communication between multiple users in a shared chat environment. It features essential chat functionalities such as user identity with usernames, chatroom support, message timestamps, and emoji integration, providing a experience for users live conversations. The project was built using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary development environment, allowing for efficient code editing, testing, and debugging. The backend of the application is powered by Express.js and uses Socket.IO.

Through this project, i had many complications but i overcame the problem with amny youtube videos of showing how to setup the vs code. then i have accessed other youtube channels for developing this project. i have used chatgpt, co-pilot, deepseek etc for debugging or fixing the errors. i have also taken the sample idea of geeksforgeeks to develop the project. this had helped me to understand each and every concept of the project. as this was the task 2 it was difficult to continue the process development.

The project’s inspiration and structure were also influenced by publicly available examples on educational platforms such as GeeksforGeeks, where sample WebSocket projects helped in designing the flow of user interactions and message broadcasting. The interface is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, maintaining a clean and responsive layout. Users are prompted to enter a username upon joining, after which they can select a chat room or join an existing one. Messages sent are displayed in the chat window along with the sender’s name and a timestamp, ensuring context is preserved. 

The backend, developed with Node.js and Express, handles room logic and routes user events to appropriate sockets. The server manages user connections, disconnections, room joins, and broadcasts messages to other users in the room using Socket.IO’s built-in room functionalities. While this version stores messages in-memory, it is structured in a way that allows easy expansion, such as integrating a database like MongoDB to store chat history or user logs.

In summary, the outcome of the project is that, i have successfully developed a real time chat application, where it contains features like, sending messages to the multiple users, time stamp of the messages, there is also a login page to join the chat and it also user friendly. i have learned many new concepts.
